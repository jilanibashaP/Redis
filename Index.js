// you can think of Redis as a medium or a connection interface that allows client applications to access and interact with in-memory data stored on a server. Here's how this works and why Redis is often considered a "connecting medium

// What is Redis?
// // Redis is an open-source (BSD licensed) in-memory data structure store. It is used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis supports various data structures including strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries, and streams.

// Let’s break the Redis word into 3 parts.

// RE(Remote ) DI(Dictionary ) S(Server)

// Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Server (Redis) and is essentially a key-value store.


// Redis operates as a standalone server. You need to run the Redis server (redis-server) on a machine (or cloud instance like AWS EC2). This server handles all client requests (from applications, microservices, etc.).

// Clients can connect to the Redis server using a Redis client library for their respective programming language (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.). The Redis server listens for commands on a specific port (default is 6379).

// Redis supports many data structures, and it can be thought of as a key-value store, but it also provides more advanced data structures like hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, and streams.



// Using a HashMap in a different server's RAM to replace Redis might seem like a feasible approach at first, but there are several significant problems and limitations with this method. Let’s break it down.

// Why Redis Is Better for Distributed Systems
// Redis is purpose-built for in-memory data storage and distributed systems. It abstracts away the complexities of:

// Concurrency
// Networking
// Durability
// Scaling
// Building a system like Redis from scratch with a HashMap would require replicating these features, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and unnecessary when Redis already exists.



// Optional Persistence: Redis can save snapshots of data to the disk (using RDB or AOF) for durability, but the primary working copy of the data remains in RAM.


// Do We Need to Start a Redis Server?
// Yes, Redis operates as a server application.
// You need to start the Redis server process (redis-server) on the machine where Redis is installed. This server listens for requests from clients on a specific port (default is 6379).


// Do We Need to Ensure Sufficient RAM?
// Yes, since Redis stores data in RAM:

// Plan for RAM Usage:

// The amount of available RAM on the machine determines how much data Redis can store.
// Redis will consume memory as more data is stored. If memory runs out, you may need to:
// Upgrade the machine's RAM.
// Optimize your data storage strategy (e.g., eviction policies).
// Set a Memory Limit:

// You can configure a memory limit in Redis to avoid exceeding the available RAM on the server. For example:
// bash
// Copy code
// maxmemory 2gb
// maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
// This ensures Redis doesn't consume all the server's memory, which could cause system instability.
// Eviction Policies:

// If the memory limit is reached, Redis uses eviction policies to decide which keys to remove (e.g., least recently used keys).





// Do We Need to Pay for RAM?
// If Redis Is Running on Your Own Machine:
// You don’t directly "pay" for RAM, but the cost is part of the machine's hardware or hosting fees.
// For example:
// On a personal server, upgrading from 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM incurs a one-time hardware cost.
// If Redis Is Running in the Cloud:
// Yes, RAM is a key factor in cloud costs because cloud providers charge based on the machine's configuration.
// For example:
// On AWS, pricing depends on the instance type (e.g., EC2) and the amount of RAM.
// Amazon ElastiCache (Managed Redis) has specific pricing for memory usage.
// Approximate RAM Cost on Cloud Platforms:
// AWS EC2 Instances:
// RAM costs are included in the hourly pricing of the instance. For example:
// A t2.medium instance with 4 GB RAM costs around $0.046/hour (~$33/month).
// For more RAM, you’d need larger instances, which are more expensive.
// Managed Redis Services:
// Providers like AWS ElastiCache or Azure Redis Cache charge based on the amount of memory allocated.


// Key Considerations for RAM Costs in Redis
// Plan Your Memory Usage:

// Estimate how much data you need to store and match it to the server's RAM.
// Monitor usage over time to adjust capacity.
// Optimize Storage:

// Use efficient data structures and compression to minimize RAM usage.
// Set TTL (time-to-live) for keys to automatically free up memory.
// Use Eviction Policies:

// Configure Redis to evict old or unused data when it runs out of memory.
// Example Scenario
// You run Redis on a cloud instance with 8 GB RAM:
// Approximate monthly cost (AWS): ~$50-$100 depending on the instance type.
// If data exceeds 8 GB, you'll need to upgrade to a larger instance or configure eviction policies.
